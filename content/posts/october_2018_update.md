Hello everyone!

It's hard to believe that Heather and I (Noah) and the kids have been in the Twin Cities now for almost half a year. After so long, we thought it would be encouraging to send along an update on how we're doing and what we've been up to. Even though we're out of state, we can at least not be fully out of mind (to misappropriate an idiom).

Our move out to Minneapolis and the few months after were very challenging for everyone. We lived in a duplex on the north side of the river for two months as a short-term rental and we quickly knew we had to find another place for the family. Between dealing with issues such as persistent mice and their mess that we couldn't get rid of to the unsuitability and lack of safety for the kids, we started searching for another place almost right away. Combined with the isolation and loneliness that initially came with going from a church of a few hundred to one of a couple thousand where we didn't have connections yet, it made for an especially trying time. Elias in particular took the move hard and was often sad and confused as he got used to a new home and church. God has certainly taught us to lean ever more into his call on our family and the promises he's made in his Word through this time.

While we still wrestle with discouragement and doubt on days, the Lord has blessed us now with a place of our own. After running the numbers, we chose to go ahead and buy a house. It has been a great gift to have a house here for the kids to make their own and play outside whenever they like (the duplex we rented before really only had an alley for a backyard) and it actually works out to cost us less than a comparable rental with everything considered. While finances are still real tight, we're now able to stay mostly in the black as long as I can get in the hours at work that we need. The lifting of that economic stress has been refreshing after the pressure of the first few months out here. I praise God often for giving me such a flexible job and understanding boss and teammates during this season.

As for seminary itself, I'm now about halfway through the first semester. Greek has been the most rewarding course, as I've begun to dig into understanding the Gospel of Mark deeper than ever before. The authority of Jesus in his teaching and power is made more evident in every verse we study. Mid-terms are around the corner and I'm preparing a few essays for our Old Testament Background course to compose from memory in a little over a week now. The pace is challenging to balance with work and family time, but the rigorous learning and stretching has been valuable. The cohort of guys in my seminary class have all become fast friends, and I've been encouraged to walk alongside a number of other men going through the same preparation together. Heather has also been able to connect with a few of the seminary wives and spend time growing friendships. One family in particular lives near to us, and Heather and the kids are regularly spending time together and going to story times at the library with them.

Our weekly chapel at Bethlehem College and Seminary recently featured Dr. John Beckham (Hebrew professor) sharing a message titled "Though He Slay Me, I Will Hope In Him". What a powerful reminder it was of God's sovereign control over all things and his use of suffering in our lives to purify and mold us. I'd encourage you to listen in to the recording if you have time: https://vimeo.com/292821440. While the temptation to lose heart remains (our furnace went out for a bit this last weekend leaving us without heat for a while!), I know that we can rest in the knowledge that God is both all-powerful and all-loving towards those he's called to himself.

We are so grateful to have you all as friends supporting us as we're on this adventure. We covet all the prayers and encouragement we've received and appreciate you all so much! Hope to see everyone soon!
