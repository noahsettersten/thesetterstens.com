<h1 id="hello-friends">Hello friends!</h1>

<p>Another winter is nearly behind us and the smells and sounds of spring are increasing every day. We&rsquo;re all enjoying the emerging birdsong and the kids are eager to get outside as they see the hills of snow finally melt away. Our recently started small group that meets in our home has grown now to include two other families and we&rsquo;re expectant of new life in community to come as much as the new life we see being born outside. The last family of our seminary cohort recently moved to Minnesota after an extended time caring for their daughter after her premature birth, and it&rsquo;s been great having them finally here with us.</p>

<h2 id="noah">NOAH</h2>

<p>I (Noah) am pressing through my second semester here at Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary and have been honored to be asked to serve as a teaching and research assistant for one of my professors in the coming years. I&rsquo;ll have the chance to grow and learn in a number of practical hands–on ways, and I&rsquo;m excited for being given the opportunity.  Otherwise, I&rsquo;m juggling a few larger projects: I&rsquo;ve mostly finished writing a piece on the apostle Paul&rsquo;s teaching and speaking in Corinth, and I&rsquo;m gathering my notes together from a missionary I interviewed for another research project. Outside of coursework, I&rsquo;ve been able to mentor a college freshman over the past few months and am grateful for how that relationship has begun to grow more.</p>

<h2 id="heather">HEATHER</h2>

<p>Heather has thankfully been feeling much better than she had earlier in this pregnancy. Tiredness is still a challenge, but we praise God for the lack of nausea and sickness. Our new baby is expected for early June, but we anticipate their arrival a couple weeks before then even. Heather led the way in guiding our family to a paleo diet recently, which has helped ease the kids&rsquo; allergies and relieve other health issues too. She&rsquo;s also been creating her own patterns and designs for knitted and crocheted hats, bonnets, and other clothing that have been a blessing to others too.</p>

<h2 id="elias-sofia">ELIAS &amp; SOFIA</h2>

<p>Elias is nearly three now and his communication and creativity is growing so quickly. We&rsquo;re always amazed at the complexity and layers of the sentences this boy can put together intuitively. His imagination is expanding and we find him inventing new things all the time. Sofia has been getting into books more lately and loves to snuggle with one of us as we read together. Her cries of &ldquo;read it! read it!&rdquo; have become a common sound in our house. One of our greatest joys has been seeing the two of them understand in small ways who God is and how he created the world. Eli has started learning Bible verses and Sofia sings a few words of hymns with us.</p>

<p>Our faithful God is always refining and molding us through the little and great things and we&rsquo;re holding tighter to his promises as he teaches us to depend on him more.</p>

<p><em>In Christ,
The Setterstens</em></p>

<h3 id="word">WORD:</h3>

<p>I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
— 1 Corinthians 2:3–5</p>

			<description>Hello everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that Heather and I (Noah) and the kids have been in the Twin Cities now for almost half a year. After so long, we thought it would be encouraging to send along an update on how we&amp;rsquo;re doing and what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to. Even though we&amp;rsquo;re out of state, we can at least not be fully out of mind (to misappropriate an idiom).</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that Heather and I (Noah) and the kids have been in the Twin Cities now for almost half a year. After so long, we thought it would be encouraging to send along an update on how we&rsquo;re doing and what we&rsquo;ve been up to. Even though we&rsquo;re out of state, we can at least not be fully out of mind (to misappropriate an idiom).</p>

<p>Our move out to Minneapolis and the few months after were very challenging for everyone. We lived in a duplex on the north side of the river for two months as a short-term rental and we quickly knew we had to find another place for the family. Between dealing with issues such as persistent mice and their mess that we couldn&rsquo;t get rid of to the unsuitability and lack of safety for the kids, we started searching for another place almost right away. Combined with the isolation and loneliness that initially came with going from a church of a few hundred to one of a couple thousand where we didn&rsquo;t have connections yet, it made for an especially trying time. Elias in particular took the move hard and was often sad and confused as he got used to a new home and church. God has certainly taught us to lean ever more into his call on our family and the promises he&rsquo;s made in his Word through this time.</p>

<p>While we still wrestle with discouragement and doubt on days, the Lord has blessed us now with a place of our own. After running the numbers, we chose to go ahead and buy a house. It has been a great gift to have a house here for the kids to make their own and play outside whenever they like (the duplex we rented before really only had an alley for a backyard) and it actually works out to cost us less than a comparable rental with everything considered. While finances are still real tight, we&rsquo;re now able to stay mostly in the black as long as I can get in the hours at work that we need. The lifting of that economic stress has been refreshing after the pressure of the first few months out here. I praise God often for giving me such a flexible job and understanding boss and teammates during this season.</p>

<p>As for seminary itself, I&rsquo;m now about halfway through the first semester. Greek has been the most rewarding course, as I&rsquo;ve begun to dig into understanding the Gospel of Mark deeper than ever before. The authority of Jesus in his teaching and power is made more evident in every verse we study. Mid-terms are around the corner and I&rsquo;m preparing a few essays for our Old Testament Background course to compose from memory in a little over a week now. The pace is challenging to balance with work and family time, but the rigorous learning and stretching has been valuable. The cohort of guys in my seminary class have all become fast friends, and I&rsquo;ve been encouraged to walk alongside a number of other men going through the same preparation together. Heather has also been able to connect with a few of the seminary wives and spend time growing friendships. One family in particular lives near to us, and Heather and the kids are regularly spending time together and going to story times at the library with them.</p>

<p>Our weekly chapel at Bethlehem College and Seminary recently featured Dr. John Beckham (Hebrew professor) sharing a message titled &ldquo;Though He Slay Me, I Will Hope In Him&rdquo;. What a powerful reminder it was of God&rsquo;s sovereign control over all things and his use of suffering in our lives to purify and mold us. I&rsquo;d encourage you to listen in to the recording if you have time: <a href="https://vimeo.com/292821440">https://vimeo.com/292821440</a>. While the temptation to lose heart remains (our furnace went out for a bit this last weekend leaving us without heat for a while!), I know that we can rest in the knowledge that God is both all-powerful and all-loving towards those he&rsquo;s called to himself.</p>

<p>We are so grateful to have you all as friends supporting us as we&rsquo;re on this adventure. We covet all the prayers and encouragement we&rsquo;ve received and appreciate you all so much! Hope to see everyone soon!</p>

<p>He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?” And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
