<p>Another winter is nearly behind us and the smells and sounds of spring are increasing every day. We&rsquo;re all enjoying the emerging birdsong and the kids are eager to get outside as they see the hills of snow finally melt away. Our recently started small group that meets in our home has grown now to include two other families and we&rsquo;re expectant of new life in community to come as much as the new life we see being born outside. The last family of our seminary cohort recently moved to Minnesota after an extended time caring for their daughter after her premature birth, and it&rsquo;s been great having them finally here with us.</p>

<h2 id="noah">NOAH<a href="#noah" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>I (Noah) am pressing through my second semester here at Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary and have been honored to be asked to serve as a teaching and research assistant for one of my professors in the coming years. I&rsquo;ll have the chance to grow and learn in a number of practical hands–on ways, and I&rsquo;m excited for being given the opportunity.  Otherwise, I&rsquo;m juggling a few larger projects: I&rsquo;ve mostly finished writing a piece on the apostle Paul&rsquo;s teaching and speaking in Corinth, and I&rsquo;m gathering my notes together from a missionary I interviewed for another research project. Outside of coursework, I&rsquo;ve been able to mentor a college freshman over the past few months and am grateful for how that relationship has begun to grow more.</p>

<h2 id="heather">HEATHER<a href="#heather" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>Heather has thankfully been feeling much better than she had earlier in this pregnancy. Tiredness is still a challenge, but we praise God for the lack of nausea and sickness. Our new baby is expected for early June, but we anticipate their arrival a couple weeks before then even. Heather led the way in guiding our family to a paleo diet recently, which has helped ease the kids&rsquo; allergies and relieve other health issues too. She&rsquo;s also been creating her own patterns and designs for knitted and crocheted hats, bonnets, and other clothing that have been a blessing to others too.</p>

<h2 id="elias-sofia">ELIAS &amp; SOFIA<a href="#elias-sofia" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>Elias is nearly three now and his communication and creativity is growing so quickly. We&rsquo;re always amazed at the complexity and layers of the sentences this boy can put together intuitively. His imagination is expanding and we find him inventing new things all the time. Sofia has been getting into books more lately and loves to snuggle with one of us as we read together. Her cries of &ldquo;read it! read it!&rdquo; have become a common sound in our house. One of our greatest joys has been seeing the two of them understand in small ways who God is and how he created the world. Eli has started learning Bible verses and Sofia sings a few words of hymns with us.</p>

<p>Our faithful God is always refining and molding us through the little and great things and we&rsquo;re holding tighter to his promises as he teaches us to depend on him more.</p>

<p><em>In Christ,
The Setterstens</em></p>

<p>I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
— 1 Corinthians 2:3–5</p>
